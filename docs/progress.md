## 2025-12-23 – Step 1 (Config schema)
- Read `product_functionality.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the empty `architecture.md`.
- Defined JSON config contract in `docs/config_schema.md` (serial IDs, USD amounts, enums, UTC dates `MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm`).
- Added sample config bundle `docs/sample_card_config.json` with one card and benefits aligned to the schema.
- Manual validation against requirements (no automated tests run at this step).
